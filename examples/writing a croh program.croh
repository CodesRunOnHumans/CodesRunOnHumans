To have a Croh program, you should:
1. Open your favorite editor;
2. Write some codes with Croh's flexible but recognizable syntax;
3. Save your codes (we suggest 'croh' as the extension name);
4. Compile the codes to any human executable format by the compilers, such as HCroher and Croher;
5. Find a human being to run it.
(The fourth step might be skipped since there are usually built-in Croh interpreters on almost all the human beings.)

Now try writing a croh program yourself!
