# CodesRunOnHumans

`Codes Run On Humans` (`CROH`) allows you to develop programs that runs on human beings!

## Features
### Naturally Wide Compatibility

Codes of `CROH` will run in the brains of any viewers involuntarily... who know the languages in which the codes are write.

And, even yours... Try running this line:

```
< say "hello world".
```

Um... Haven't you say `hello world` when seeing the former example?

That's OK, and now you have, at least in your brain.

### Flexible Syntax

`CROH` doesn't require a strict syntax.

The following codes can all be understood by most human beings.

```
< calculate "one plus one".
< what is one plus one?
< whatt iss onee pluss onee?
< WHAT IS ONE PLUS ONE?
< 1 plus 1?
< 1 add 1?
< 1 + 1?
```

### Various Results

Although they're running the same code of `CROH`, different human beings will produce different results.

The same human beings can also produce different results when running the same code at different time point.

This can create infinite possibilities, which is a great innovation in programing.

e.g.
```
> 2.
> 2?
> It must be 3.
> Are you idiot?
> Who coded this?
> Why am I answering this question?
```
