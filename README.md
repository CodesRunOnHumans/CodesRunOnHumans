# CodesRunOnHumans

`Codes Run On Humans` (`CROH`) allows you to develop programs that run on human beings!

## Getting Started

`CROH` is quite easy to use.

All the things you should do are:

1. Open your favorite editor.
2. Write some codes with the flexible syntax.
3. Save your codes. We suggest `croh` as the files' extension.
4. Compile the codes to human executable formats by the compilers, such as [`Croher`](https://github.com/CodesRunOnHumans/Croher/wiki).
5. Let a human being to run it.

> You can skip the step 4 because `CROH` interpreters are built into almost all the human beings.

## Features
### Naturally Wide Compatibility

Codes of `CROH` will run in the brains of anyone that knows the languages that the codes are written in.

And, even yours... Try running this line:

```codesrunonhumans
say "hello world".
```

### Flexible Syntax

`CROH` doesn't require a strict syntax.

The following codes can all be run by most human beings.

```codesrunonhumans
calculate "one plus one".
what is one plus one?
whatt iss onee pluss onee?
1 add 1?
1 + 1?
```

### Various Results

Different human beings will produce different results, although they're might running the same code of `CROH`.

The same human beings can also produce different results at different time point.

This feature brings infinite possibilities, which is a great innovation in programing.

For example, the result of `1 + 1` might be (but not limited to):

```codesrunonhumans
> 2.
> 2?
> It must be 3.
> Who coded this?
> Why am I answering this question?
```

### No Exceptions

Unlike other traditional languages, `CROH` doesn't have the system of exceptions. In fact, nothings is without exception.

## I18N

Internationalization is an important part of `CROH` since human beings can only run the codes in the languages that they have learnt.

We are currently in bad need of cross-language dictionaryies as internationalization support.
