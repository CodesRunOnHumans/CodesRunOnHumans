# Codes Run On Humans

`Codes Run On Humans` (`Croh`) allows you to develop programs that run on human beings!

## Getting Started

`Croh` is quite easy to use.

All the things you should do are:

1. Open your favorite editor;
2. Write some codes with the flexible but recognizable syntax;
3. Save your codes (we suggest `croh` as the extension name);
4. Compile the codes to any human executable format by the compilers, such as [`HCroher`](https://github.com/CodesRunOnHumans/HCroher) and [`Croher`](https://github.com/CodesRunOnHumans/Croher/wiki);
5. Find a human being to run it.

> You may skip the step 4 because there're usually built-in `Croh` interpreters on almost all the human beings.

## Features
### Naturally Wide Compatibility

Codes of `Croh` will run in the brains of anyone that knows the languages that the codes are written in.

And, even yours... Try running this line:

```croh
say "hello world".
```

### Flexible Syntax

`Croh` doesn't have a strict syntax.

The following codes can all be run on almost all human beings who knows a little about English.

```croh
calculate "one plus one".
what is one plus one?
whatt iss onee pluss onee??
1 add 1?
1 + 1?
```

### Various Results

Different human beings may produce different results, although the code they're running is totally the
 same, while the same human being can also produce different results at different time.

This feature brings infinite possibilities, which is a great innovation.

For example, the result of `1 + 1` might be:

```croh
> 2.
> 2?
> It must be 3.
> Who coded this?
> Why am I asked the stupid question?
```

### No Exceptions

Unlike other traditional languages, `Croh` doesn't have an exception system.

That's because we don't need one. In fact, for `Croh`, nothing goes with exception and nothing goes without exception.

## I18N

Internationalization is an important part of `Croh` since human beings can only run the codes in the languages that they have learnt.

We are currently and possibly continuously in bad need of cross-language dictionaries for internationalization support.
