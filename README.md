# Codes Run On Humans

`Codes Run On Humans` (`Croh`) allows you to develop programs that run on human beings!

## Getting Started

It's quite easy to start your `Croh` journey.

Here are all the things you should do:

1. Open your favorite editor;
2. Write some codes with the flexible but recognizable syntax;
3. Save your codes (we suggest `croh` as the extension name);
4. Compile the codes to any human executable format by the compilers, such as [`HCroher`](https://github.com/CodesRunOnHumans/HCroher) and [`Croher`](https://github.com/CodesRunOnHumans/Croher/wiki);
5. Find a human being to run it.

> The fourth step might be skipped since there are usually built-in `Croh` interpreters on almost all the human beings.

> You know what? The newest natural intelligence technology has been included in `Croh`. Try executing [`writing-a-croh-program.croh`](./examples/writing-a-croh-program.croh) yourself, and there will be a satisfying `Croh` program.

## Features

Now we will list some exciting features of `Croh`, and more is waiting to be discovered.

### Naturally Wide Compatibility

Any human being's brain can run a well-written `Croh` program. There is only one requirement: they know about the languages that the codes are written in.

And, even yours... Try running this line:

```croh
say "hello world!"
```

### Flexible Syntax

`Croh` doesn't have a strict syntax: natural languages can be parsed by most human beings, and even those includes wrong words or sentences are still acceptable.

The following codes can all be run on almost all human beings who knows a little about English.

```croh
calculate "one plus one".
what is one plus one?
whatt iss onee pluss onee??
1 add 1?
1 + 1?
```

### Various Results

Different human beings may produce different results, although the code they're running is totally the
 same. Meanwhile, the same human being can also produce different results at different time.

This feature brings infinite possibilities. For example, the result of `1 + 1` might be:

```croh
> 2.
> 2?
> Trust me. It must be 3.
> Who coded this?
> Who asked the stupid question?
```

### No Exceptions

Unlike other traditional languages, `Croh` doesn't have an exception system.

In fact, in `Croh`, nothing goes with exception. Nothing goes without exception as well.

### No Infinite Loops

There won't be any infinite loops or recursions in `Croh`.

If you find it hard to figure out a condition for ending a loop, just let it be a infinite loop in the code, and the human beings who run the code will automatically end it.

> Try running [`looping.croh`](./examples/looping.croh) yourself and you will have a better understand to this feature.

## I18N

Since human beings can only run the codes in the languages that they have learnt, internationalization is an important part of `Croh` programs which the developers should pay attention to.

Actually, we ourselves are currently and possibly continuously in bad need of internationalization support for our `Croh` programs.
