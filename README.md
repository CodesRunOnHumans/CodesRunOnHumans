# Codes Run On Humans

`Codes Run On Humans` (`Croh`) allows you to develop programs that run on human beings!

## Getting Started

It's quite easy to start your `Croh` journey.

All the things you should do are:

1. Open your favorite editor;
2. Write some codes with the flexible but recognizable syntax;
3. Save your codes (we suggest `croh` as the extension name);
4. Compile the codes to any human executable format by the compilers, such as [`HCroher`](https://github.com/CodesRunOnHumans/HCroher) and [`Croher`](https://github.com/CodesRunOnHumans/Croher/wiki);
5. Find a human being to run it.

> The fourth step might be skipped since there are usually built-in `Croh` interpreters on almost all the human beings.

> You know what? Without reading the above content, just execute [`writing-a-croh-program.croh`](./examples/writing-a-croh-program.croh) by yourself, and you will have a satisfying `Croh` program.

## Features

Here we listed some exciting features of `Croh` and more is waiting for you to discover.

### Naturally Wide Compatibility

Codes of `Croh` will run in the brains of any human beings that know the languages that the codes are written in.

And, even yours... Try running this line:

```croh
say "hello world!"
```

### Flexible Syntax

`Croh` doesn't require a strict syntax and supports natural languages as the codes.

The following codes can all be run on almost all human beings who knows a little about English.

```croh
calculate "one plus one".
what is one plus one?
whatt iss onee pluss onee??
1 add 1?
1 + 1?
```

### Various Results

Different human beings may produce different results, although the code they're running is totally the
 same. Meanwhile, the same human being can also produce different results at different time.

For example, the result of `1 + 1` might be:

```croh
> 2.
> 2?
> It must be 3.
> Who coded this?
> Who asked the stupid question?
```

This feature brings infinite possibilities. What a great innovation!

### No Exceptions

Unlike other traditional languages, `Croh` doesn't have any exception systems.

In fact, in `Croh`, nothing goes with exception and nothing goes without exception.

### No Infinite Loops

There won't be any infinite loops or recursions in `Croh`.

If you find it hard to figure out a condition for ending a loop, just let it be a infinite loop in the code, and the human beings who run the code will automatically end it.

> Try running [`looping.croh`](./examples/looping.croh) yourself and you will have a better understand to this feature.

## I18N

Internationalization is an important part of `Croh` since human beings can only run the codes in the languages that they have learnt.

We are currently and possibly continuously in bad need of cross-language dictionaries for internationalization support.
