# CodesRunOnHumans

`Codes Run On Humans` (`CROH`) allows you to develop programs that run on human beings!

## Features
### Naturally Wide Compatibility

Codes of `CROH` will run in the brains of any viewers involuntarily... who know the languages that the codes are write in.

And, even yours... Try running this line:

```
< say "hello world".
```

Um... Haven't you say `hello world` when seeing the former example?

That's OK, and now you have, at least in your brain.

### Flexible Syntax

`CROH` doesn't require a strict syntax.

The following codes can all be run by most human beings.

```
< calculate "one plus one".
< what is one plus one?
< whatt iss onee pluss onee?
< WHAT IS ONE PLUS ONE?
< 1 plus 1?
< 1 add 1?
< 1 + 1?
```

### Various Results

Different human beings will produce different results, although they're might running the same code of `CROH`.

The same human beings can also produce different results of the same code at different time point.

This feature brings infinite possibilities, which is a great innovation in programing.

e.g.
```
> 2.
> 2?
> It must be 3.
> Are you idiot?
> Who coded this?
> Why am I answering this question?
```

## Getting Started

`CROH` is quite easy to use.

All the things you should do are:

1. Open your favorite editor.
2. Write some codes with the flexible syntax.
3. Save your codes.
4. Show the codes to any human beings.

## I18N

Internationalization is an important part of `CROH` since human beings can only run the codes that they have learnt.

We are currently in bad need of cross-language dictionaryies as Internationalization Packages.
